# Talking Map

I really like the idea of the ESRI StoryMaps. However, since I don't want to be dependent on ESRI and their technology, I decided to create my own storymap, which I can use for online presentations of geographical phenomena. It is based on leaflet and currently requires JavaScript programming skills to use. What this "framework" does is to support you with the layout of the maps and the stories. You still need to create the maps programmatically.

# Usage

You probably want to use the ESRI StoryMaps instead of this one. I am developing the Talking Map in my spare time. To use it, you still need lots of manual work and programming, and it probably does not run smoothly on different browsers/ screen sizes etc.

If you still want to use it, you can do it for any purpose you want. If you improve it, it would be nice if you could send me your improvements.
